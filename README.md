A state-of-the-art precision counting system that combines YOLO/ONNX/CVIMODEL object detection with ByteTrack, currently the most advanced multi-object tracking algorithm, and innovative ROI-based methodology. Through extensive research and empirical validation, this implementation achieves unprecedented accuracy in bidirectional counting, particularly excelling in challenging environments where traditional methods often fail. My approach integrates real-time detection precision with ByteTrack's superior tracking capabilities, resulting in a high-precision object detection and counting system for diverse applications.

## Research Background

This project emerged from intensive research and experimentation in solving the challenging problem of precise object counting in crowded, dynamic environments. The methodology developed here addresses several critical issues in real-time object counting:

- Accurate bidirectional counting in crowded scenarios
- Robust tracking in varying lighting conditions (day/night, indoor/outdoor)
- Lightweight for hardware with limited resources and processing power
- Precise object differentiation in overlapping situations
- Real-time processing capability on embedded systems
- Adaptive performance in high-traffic environments
- Resilient tracking through occlusions and complex movements
- High accuracy in varying weather conditions (for outdoor applications)

## System Architecture

### ROI-Based Counting Methodology

![ROI Method](docs/images/roi_method.png)
*Figure 1: ROI-based counting methodology illustration*

The system employs a sophisticated Region of Interest (ROI) approach using the ROI counting equation:
```python
def obj_in_roi(obj, roi):
    x = obj.x + obj.w // 2
    y = obj.y + obj.h // 2
    if x >= roi[0] and x <= roi[0] + roi[2]:
        if y < roi[1]:
            return -1  # Above ROI
        if y > roi[1] + roi[3]:
            return 1   # Below ROI
        return 0       # Inside ROI
    return None       # Outside ROI
```
The obj_in_roi function is designed to determine an object's position relative to a defined counting zone (ROI - Region of Interest). First, it calculates the center point of the detected object by finding the middle point of its bounding box. This single point represents the object's position more reliably than using its entire area.

The function then performs two crucial checks: First, it verifies if the object is horizontally aligned with the counting zone by checking if its center X-coordinate falls within the ROI's left and right boundaries. If the object isn't horizontally aligned, it's considered outside our area of interest and ignored (returns None).

For objects that are horizontally aligned, the function then determines their vertical position by comparing their center Y-coordinate with the ROI's top and bottom boundaries. This check classifies the object's position into three categories:
- Above the counting zone (returns -1)
- Inside the counting zone (returns 0)
- Below the counting zone (returns 1)

By tracking how these position values change over time, the system can determine the direction of movement and maintain precise counts.

### Understanding IoU (Intersection over Union)

![IOU Calculation](docs/images/iou.png)
*Figure 2: IoU calculation visualization in object tracking*

The IoU metric is fundamental to my counting system's accuracy. The IoU equation plays a crucial role in our counting method's precision, particularly when integrated with ByteTrack's advanced tracking capabilities. The carefully tuned thresholds (0.45 for detection and 0.8 for tracking) provide an optimal balance between accuracy and processing efficiency, making this implementation particularly effective in challenging scenarios like school bus monitoring and crowd counting.

## Technical Parameters and Optimization

The system uses carefully tuned parameters based on extensive testing:

### Detection Parameters
```python
conf_threshold = 0.3   # Detection confidence threshold
iou_threshold = 0.45   # IoU threshold for detection
```
- **conf_threshold**: Set to 0.3 to balance between false positives and detection sensitivity
- **iou_threshold**: 0.45 provides optimal overlap detection while maintaining distinct object separation

### Tracking Parameters
```python
track_thresh = 0.4     # Tracking confidence threshold
high_thresh = 0.6      # New track addition threshold
match_thresh = 0.8     # Object matching threshold
max_history_num = 18    # Track history length
```

Parameter justification:
- **track_thresh (0.4)**: Balances tracking stability and sensitivity
- **high_thresh (0.6)**: Ensures new tracks are only created for high-confidence detections
- **match_thresh (0.8)**: High threshold ensures accurate object persistence across frames
- **max_history_num (18)**: Optimal buffer size for tracking without excessive memory usage
